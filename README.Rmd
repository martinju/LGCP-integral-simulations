# LGCP normalization constant approximation - simulation source code

This repository contains the results and source code for the simulation experiments in the paper 

Jullum, M. (2020) *Investigating mesh based approximation methods for the normalization constant in the Cox process likelihood*, Stat, in press, [doi.org/10.1002/sta4.285](https://doi.org/10.1002/sta4.285)

The preprint of the paper is available [here](paper_preprint.pdf),
and the supporting information (preprint) [here](paper_supporting_information_preprint.pdf)


#### Main files

- `source_code/help_functions.R` Functions containing the implementation of all the differnet approximation methods for the integral in question, in addition to a series of help functions related to the simulation experiments.
- `source_code/full_simulations_script.R` The script used to carry out the full simulation experiment in the paper. The script also contains the short test version that quickly runs trough some parameter combinations (to check that the script works as intended).
- `source_code/permutation_tests.R` The script used to carry out the permutation tests mentioned in the paper.
- `source_code/illustrating_mesh_approximated_field.R` A self-contained script for illustating how to approximate a given field on specific mesh using the finite element method (FEM).





#### Full result table for simulations experiments
A sort and searchable table with the full simulation results is available [here](https://martinju.github.io/LGCP-normConst-simulations/sim_res.html).

#### Permutation tests
A sort and searchable table with results for permutation tests of pairwise differences between  all combinations 
of the approximation methods, for each parameter combination is available 
[here](https://martinju.github.io/LGCP-normConst-simulations/permut_tests.html).

Any questions about the paper, simulations or scripts can be raised by opening a GitHub issue, or sending an email to 
the author [jullum@nr.no](<mailto:jullum@nr.no?subject=LGCP-normConst-simulations>).

<!-- ### Source code files -->

<!-- All source code for the simulations are available under /Source code -->

<!-- File  | Description -->
<!-- ------------- | ------------- -->
<!--   simulation_script.R                         | This is the main script executing the simulation experiment in the paper. Settings for full simulation is commented out, such that the script can be ran quickly.  -->
<!-- timing_deterministic_integration_methods.R  | Script for timing the deterministic integration methods. -->
<!-- help_function.R | All functions used in the above scripts. Ufortunatly, almost no documentation is available.  -->
