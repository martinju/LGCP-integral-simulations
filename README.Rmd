# LGCP normalization constant approximation - simulation source code

This repository contains the results and source code for the simulation experiments in the paper 

*Investigating mesh based approximation methods for the normalization constant in the Cox process likelihood* by 
Martin Jullum.

A link to the pre-print version of the paper will be made available here in due time.

The sort and searchable table with the full results is available 
[here](https://martinju.github.io/LGCP-normConst-simulations/).

Any questions about the paper, simulations or scripts can be raised by opening a Github issue, or sending an email to 
the author [jullum@nr.no](<mailto:jullum@nr.no?subject=LGCP-normConst-simulations>).

<!-- ### Source code files -->

<!-- All source code for the simulations are available under /Source code -->

<!-- File  | Description -->
<!-- ------------- | ------------- -->
<!--   simulation_script.R                         | This is the main script executing the simulation experiment in the paper. Settings for full simulation is commented out, such that the script can be ran quickly.  -->
<!-- timing_deterministic_integration_methods.R  | Script for timing the deterministic integration methods. -->
<!-- help_function.R | All functions used in the above scripts. Ufortunatly, almost no documentation is available.  -->
